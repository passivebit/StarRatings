# StarRatings
This project shows 5 - star rating view in a UITableView. The rating view uses CALayers and drawing and no use of images. It demonstrates scroll without any laggy effect which happens when layers and custom drawing is performed in a UITableViewCell. 

Also, different shapes can be added instead of star shape and count can be changed to increase or decrease the number of stars.
